# Password Generator

# Description
The purpose of this project was to design a program that randomly generates a password. This program has the ability to collect user input and create a password with specific parameters. The program is capable of creating a password with a length between 8 and 128 characters. It can also include any combination of one or more of the following characteristics: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

# Functionality
Upon requesting a password (by clicking the generate password button) the user is confronted with several window prompts/confirms. The prompts/confirms are as follows:
- How many characters do you want your password to contain? Must enter a number between 8 and 128 characters. 
- Do you want your password to contain lower case characters?
- Do you want your password to contain upper case characters?
- Do you want your password to contain numbers?
- Do you want your password to contain special characters?

As long as the user chooses at least one of the password characteristics then a password of any given length within the length parameters will be created.
The final password will appear in the textbox above the generate password button.
The user then has two options the first is to clear the generated password from the text area by clicking the Clear Password button. The second option is that the user can choose to click the Generate Password button to generate a new password, which after answering all the prompts will replace the old password in the text area with a new password.
